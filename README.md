## Playing around

If you're interested in playing around with the platform yourself, you'll need nodeJS.

- After installing nodeJS navigate to the repository on a command line.
- Run the command ```npm install``` this will install the required dependencies to run this.
- Wait for the installation of dependencies to finish. Don't worry, these will only be installed into this folder.
- Run the command ```npm start``` which will run the program.
- Open a web-browser and navigate to the address http://localhost:8080.
